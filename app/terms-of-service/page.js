                            <p>Zone reserves the right to unilaterally terminate your account as outlined in Point 4 of the Terms of Use regarding User Conduct and Rules on the Platform.

                            <p>These terms will be governed by the laws of India, without regard to conflict of laws principles, and any disputes arising from them will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts and authorities in New Delhi.

                            <h2 className="font-semibold">16. Disclaimer</h2>
                            <p>You acknowledge and agree that by accessing the services on the Platform and engaging in transactions, you do so at your own risk. It is your responsibility to exercise caution and judgment before entering into any transactions through Zone. We shall not be held liable for any actions or inactions of sellers nor for any breach of conditions, representations, or warranties by the sellers or manufacturers of the products. We explicitly disclaim any responsibility or liability in this regard and do not mediate or resolve disputes between you and the sellers or manufacturers.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, we expressly disclaim any warranties or representations, whether express or implied, regarding the quality, suitability, accuracy, reliability, completeness, timeliness, performance, safety, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or legality of the products listed, displayed, or transacted on the Platform. While we take precautions to ensure the accuracy of content, including product information and pricing, all content, information, software, products, services, and related graphics provided on the website are provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind.</p>
                            <p>It is important to note that Zone does not acquire any right, title, or interest in the products sold or displayed on the Platform, and we bear no obligations or liabilities regarding any transactions made on the Platform.</p>
                            <p>The user acknowledges that any claims related to order delivery must be reported to Zone within 7 working days from the purported delivery date as shown on the Zone portal. Failure to notify Zone within this period will be considered as acknowledgment of delivery. Zone disclaims liability for claims of non-delivery or non-receipt reported after this 7-day period.</p>
                            <h2 className="font-semibold">17. Cart Notification</h2>
                            <p>You acknowledge that if selected products in your cart are out of inventory, Zone offers you the option to choose a product from another seller. You understand that the price of the product from another seller may vary.</p>
                            <h2 className="font-semibold">18. Multiple Sellers</h2>
                            <p>You acknowledge that certain styles may be offered by multiple sellers on the Platform, and the listed price on the Platform's listing page may not necessarily be the lowest price for that style. This occurs because the seller displayed on the list page is chosen based on various factors, with price being just one of them. However, upon accessing the product display page for a specific style, you will be able to view the prices offered by all sellers for that style on the Platform.</p>
                            <h2 className="font-semibold">19. Convenience Fee</h2>
                            <p>In accordance with the Terms of Use and the following terms and conditions, Zone reserves the right to impose a convenience fee on all low-value orders placed on the Zone Platform, and for situations outlined under point 5 below, referred to herein as the "Convenience Fee."</p>
                            <p>The Convenience Fee will be clearly indicated on the shopping bag page of the Zone Platform.
                                The Convenience Fee will apply to the total order value.
                                Zone retains the authority to adjust or waive the Convenience Fee periodically.
                                The Convenience Fee will be stated in Indian Rupees. You are solely responsible for adhering to all relevant laws when making payments to Zone.
                                To safeguard customer rights, Zone retains the authority to collect Convenience Fees for all orders and to deactivate the cash-on-delivery option for accounts exhibiting a significant percentage of returns and unaccepted shipments relative to the total number of orders placed through those accounts.
