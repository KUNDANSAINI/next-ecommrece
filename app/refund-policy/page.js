                            <p>I. Please go to your Our Store account on jkmstores.com or on the app to request a refund. If you do not have a Our Store account, please click on "Save your Order" in your Our Store order email to make a return.</p>
                            <p>II. Find the relevant order in "Your Orders" and click on the "Return/Refund" button.</p>
                            <p>III. Select the item(s) you would like to return and the reason for the return. Depending on the reason you selected, you may be required to provide further information related to the order. After you provide the required information, click the "Next Step" button to proceed.</p>
                            <p>IV. If there is no need to return your item, then your final step is simply to select your refund method. You may choose to receive your refund as a Our Store credit balance or be credited back via your original payment method. Make your selection and click "Submit".</p>
                            <p>V. If you need to return your item(s), you will have the option to choose your return and refund methods. After you submit the request, we will provide you with a return label so that you can return the item(s). Return shipping is free on your first return for EVERY order within 90 days from the date of purchase.</p>
                            <p>VI. After placing all the return items in one package, please print and tape the return label we provided onto the outside of the package. Send your package back from the nearest DHL location and you're done!</p>
                            <p>VII. You can check the refund status of your item(s) on your order details page or through Our Store SMS/Email/Push notifications.</p>

                            <p>Please make sure your return package is postmarked within 14 days after you submit your return, otherwise the return process will be terminated.

                            <p>When you apply for a return, you may be offered the opportunity to get a partial refund without returning the item(s). If you accept this offer, one free return will be automatically be deducted from the number of free returns you have for this order.</p>
                            <p>If you have already returned items from an order and would like to return additional items from that same order, you can still do it as long as the 90-day window has not expired.</p>
                            <p>We recommend that you try to send back your return items in one shipment to avoid paying additional fees. This will likely also minimize the environmental impact of multiple returns.</p>
                            <p>For the second and subsequent refunds from the same order, you can use the return label we provide and pay a 4,00€ shipping fee, which will be deducted from your refund.</p>
